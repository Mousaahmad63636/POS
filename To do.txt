The Customer Debt page is no t functioning correctly. Sometimes, it fails to load the customer's balance, and the view does not update properly until I restart the entire system. To resolve this, let's recreate both the view and view model while keeping the structure of the old CustomerDebtView and its ViewModel. However, we should enhance them and integrate EventAggregator to ensure real-time UI updates.
